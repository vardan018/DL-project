# DL-project: Automatic Colorization of Black-and-White Images Using Deep Learning with Attention Mechanisms
The automatic colorization of black-and-white images is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of image content and context to predict plausible colors. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that effectively colorizes grayscale images by leveraging attention mechanisms within a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. By focusing on important regions and capturing long-range dependencies, we hope to enhance the realism and accuracy of the colorized images.
